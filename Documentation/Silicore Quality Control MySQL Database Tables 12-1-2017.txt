Silicore Quality Control MySQL Database Tables
Date: 12-1-2017
Author: Matt Nutsch

Intro:
This document explains which database tables in Silicore are related to Quality Control and what each table and field is used for.
Silicore was created as a replacement for a legacy application called Back Office. References to the legacy application mean Back Office. References to the new application mean Silicore.

NOTE - Prefix Explanation:
All of these tables have a 2 character prefix which indicates which Quality Control Laboratory they belong to.
In this document, only the "gb_" prefix is listed. However, the tables for other mines (such as "tl_") follow the same format.
