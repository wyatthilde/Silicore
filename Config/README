The 'Configuration' directory at this level can be used in correlation with 'Controls' and 'Content' pages. 

This would be a good place to contain 'administrative' level pages that allow for the customization of the related UI pages; edit pages, if you will.

Interaction with the ui_ level DB tables could contain everything from styles to data.

Food for thought.
